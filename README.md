# Simple-Image-Classification
Practice Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Project Description
In this project I try to classify the images and the process includes image preprocessing and the training of a convolutional neural network. In particular, I showcased my understanding on the coding of convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.

## Dataset
The dataset used is [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
